# Energy Efficiency Visualization

This project creates a scatter plot using Altair to visualize the relationship between energy efficiency score and gross square footage in buildings. It loads data from a CSV file containing energy disclosure data for the year 2021.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need Python installed on your system along with the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- altair

You can install these libraries using pip:
## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Place the `energy_disclosure_2021_rows.csv` file in the same directory as the Python script.
3. Run the Python script `energy_efficiency_visualization.py`.
4. The script will generate a scatter plot and save it as `chart2.html` in the same directory.

## Data Source

The energy disclosure data for the year 2021 is sourced from [[link to data source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alistairking/nyc-building-energy-efficiency-ratings)https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alistairking/nyc-building-energy-efficiency-ratings].
